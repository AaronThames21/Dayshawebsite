      <p class="dates"><strong>October 10–12, 2025</strong></p>
      <p class="pill">Theme: Hawaiian Luau</p>

      <p>We are excited this year to celebrate WCT/C.E. Murray 5th Annual Alumni Weekend, October 10–12, 2025. We will kick off the celebration with a parade. The theme for the entire weekend is a Hawaiian Luau.</p>
      <p>Though our vision is to provide a Hawaiian Luau theme experience, there are guidelines that participants are expected to follow. These guidelines have been developed to provide a structured and safe parade experience for all in attendance. Individuals are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the nature and character of C.E. Murray High School. We want the parade experience to be enjoyed by all.</p>
